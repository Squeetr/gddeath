The current goal (unlike GD Colon, who simply made it to restart the computer when you die) is to create a trigger where when you die in game it updates a connector with the values. (AKA, Discord Statuses [Showing best %], DB Use, Spreadsheets, and Discord Bot [Sending embedded messages])

Original project created by Cos8o, all i did was bugfix and compile it.
